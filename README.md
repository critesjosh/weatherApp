#Weather app

The weather app gets your current location and asks openweathermap.org for the
current weather conditions in your area.

##How to use it
Simply open the application in your browser. You can download the application files
from github or visit [this site](http://dreamcatcherproject.net/josh/weatherApp) to
access a live version. Since my hosting site does not use HTTPS, opening the
app using Google Chrome will not work, use Firefox.
